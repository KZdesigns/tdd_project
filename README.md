# TDD_Project

## Learning Goals
- Be able to explain what functionality your testing will cover
- Know the hierarchy / syntax of RSpec methods (describe, before, let, it, expect, etc.)
- Be comfortable writing RSpec tests
- Know when to use let and subject


## Do all of the following exercises TDD. That means writing specs first!

### When approaching each problem, make sure to:

- Read the entire problem statement.
- Talk with your partner to identify test cases and key functionality to expect from your code.
- Write RSpec tests.
- Write the method you now have tests for. Follow the red-green-refactor approach until all specs pass.
